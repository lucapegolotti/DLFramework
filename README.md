# DLFramework

This is a Deep Learning framework that allows for easy generation of simple and
sequential neural networks. The classes and modules can be found in the framework/
folder. A testsuite is also available and can be launched with
`python testsuite.py`. The code has been tested with Python 3.6.5 and
Pytorch 0.4.0.

Tests
-----
To launch the main driver (test), run `python test.py` in the root of the
project.

We also provide an additional test that builds and executes the same test by
using the Pytorch modules. To launch this, run `python test_torch.py`
